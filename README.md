# Jewel Game

###About the Jewel Game

A simple jQuery game in which the user will click on the 4 jewels to attempt matching the randomly generated number that is presented to the user.

The jewels generate a random value at the beginning of each round. The value is hidden from the user, until they click on the jewel.

The user wins by matching the target number, and losses by going over the target number.
